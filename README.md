# Hollerith Algorithm Error Percentage

## Main goal of this practice is finding the error percentage of Hollerith Algorithm by using Radix-Sort

For input there are 10 integers with 3 digits. At first, our program will sort them by using Radix-Sort then sort them again by using Hollerith Algorithm. At final, will find the error percentage of Hollerith Algorithm.
